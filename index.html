          <p>
            I am a Product Manager/Product Developer with a Bachelorsâ€™s in
            Business and Technology, an MBA, a background in consulting and a
            certificate for Full Stack Web Development from Columbia University.
            I have experience working successfully in teams on large projects to
            build products and applications to help clients achieve their
            business goals. I have completed requirements gathering, as well as
            debugging and testing products to ensure they meet the needs of
            clients and work as desired. I like to solve problems and find
            better ways to do things. My experience in consulting and skills
            from my certificate set me up well to work with teams to not only
            plan and develop but also build new products and applications.
